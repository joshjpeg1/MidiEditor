# MidiEditor

This was a project for a Northeastern University class, CS 3500 - Object-Oriented Design. The object of assignment was to build the model of a MIDI editor (the view and controller would be added to the project later).

### EditorOperations
The `EditorOperations` interface contains all of the methods and operations that a MidiEditor model would need. It is not parametrized over any type of object, as the design of all of the methods are ambiguous enough for a developer to define the model as they wish.


### EditorModel
The `EditorModel` class is a model for the MidiEditor that implements EditorOperations. It is the highest level of all of the classes listed here. It's visibility is public, as it is the only class that the user should be able to interact with (at the current moment).

It contains two fields: `opened`, which represents the currently opened piece; and a `List<Piece>` that represents all of the pieces in the "memory" of the editor.

The EditorModel class uses the `Piece` in the `opened` field as a delegate for all of the methods in the EditorOperations class that relate to editing pieces (such as `addNote`, `removeNote`, etc.). If no `Piece` is currently opened, the model will throw an `IllegalStateException` for methods that require one to be.


### Piece
The `Piece` class represents a single piece of music, or a song. It is the second highest level class, after `EditorModel`. It's visibility is default, as the user does not need to use any instances of a `Piece` directly.

All instances of the `Piece` class contain two fields: a unique title defined by and to be referred to by the user, and a `Map<Integer, Octave>` that represents all of the octaves in a piece.


### Octave
The `Octave` class represents a single octave in a scale. It is the third highest level class, after `Piece`. It's visibility is default, as the user does not need to know or use any instances of an `Octave` directly.

All instances of the `Octave` class only have a single field of `Map<Pitch, List<Note>>`, that represents all of the pitches and the notes in those respective pitches in an octave. `Octave` objects are independent of an octave number (1 - 10), as they are assigned that number in the `Map` of a `Piece` object.


### Note
The `Note` class represents a single note in a piece. It is the lowest level class in the hierarchy of the model. It's visibility is default, as the user does not need to know or use any instances of a `Note` directly.

All instances of the `Note` class have three fields: `position`, which marks the starting beat of the note; `duration`, which is the total duration of the note; and, `endPoint`, which marks the last beat of the note (this is automatically generated by the object when position and duration are given). `Note` objects are independent of the pitch they reside in (C, C#, etc.), as they are added to that `Pitch`'s list in the `Map` of an `Octave` object.


### Pitch
The `Pitch` enumeration contains all of the different pitches possible in an octave (C, C#, D, D#, etc.). It's visibility is public, as the user needs to input a `Pitch` as an argument to the methods of the `EditorOperations` and `EditorModel` class.

Every element of the `Pitch` enum contains a single field, `toString`, which is the exact string representation of that element.


### Utils
The `Utils` class contains generic methods that could be applied to more than one class. For example, the `reverse` method reverses any list given. It's visibility is default, as the user does not need to know of or use any of the methods of the `Utils` class directly.
